Solving a problem I've had for awhile. I need a better way to visualize certain kinds of lists in R. 

Here is a stupidly easy way to go about fixing that:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/listviewer/index.html
https://github.com/timelyportfolio/listviewer
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.tree/vignettes/data.tree.html#tree-creation
List to yaml to tree
list to json to tree
