Inspired by [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2015/02/25/i-have-journeyed-to-the-soul-o.html) I attempted a similar extraction. 

Cacao nibs from: [Cacao Nibs](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MGW81YM/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&qid=1427070471)

**Attempt One**

Using the proportion for [Cold Brew](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/dining/276drex.html?_r=0) 1/3 cups Cacao nibs soaked overnight with 1 1/2 cups of water. Result was very watery but not terrible.
