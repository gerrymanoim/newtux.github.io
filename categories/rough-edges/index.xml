      <title>Experimenting with WordVectors and Codenames</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot of Codenames and came across https://jamesmullenbach.github.io/2018/01/02/codenames-fun.html which explored using word2vec to generate clue words. This was really cool! I started wondering if we could use a similar approach to actually play as a spymaster, i.e. answering the question:
Given a game board and a side, what should my clue word + targeted number be?
This post is a collection of some things I tried and the results.</description>
