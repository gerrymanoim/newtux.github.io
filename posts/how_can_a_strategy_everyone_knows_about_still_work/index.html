<p>Any systematic strategy works for two basic reasons (though these do not have to be mutually exclusive):</p>

<ol>
<li>Risk Premium: You are receiving a proper risk premium (i.e. for stocks with higher expected risks, you get higher expected returns). You risk loss at times when that loss is most painful.</li>
<li>Behavioral: Investors make errors, or at least do not act &ldquo;rationally&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>

<p>So what happens then when a strategy becomes &ldquo;known&rdquo;:</p>

<ol>
<li>Under the risk premium explanation: The price of that risk may change, but should be robust to complete elimination. It could be more risky.</li>

<li><p>Under the behavioral explanation: More likely to go away (investors wiser, arb, more people taking the other side).</p>

<p>Sharpe Ratio = [Expected Factor Return minus Cash Return] / Factor Volatility</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Things can change in the numerator or denominator.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t quite know the magnitude effect on excess return as strategy becomes known, but we can say the general direction is down.</p>

<p>Vol is harder. During a downturn popularity/knowledge may increase vol (through trend following and then bailing, or allocation flows). So even with no change in expected return, we&rsquo;d expect decrease in Sharpe. This vol increase is less important for long term holding (as long as you make it through the short term crisis).</p>

<p>In all things, make sure the fees are reasonable.</p>
