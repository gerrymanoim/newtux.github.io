      <description>Paper Link
Any systematic strategy works for two basic reasons (though these do not have to be mutually exclusive):
 Risk Premium: You are receiving a proper risk premium (i.e. for stocks with higher expected risks, you get higher expected returns). You risk loss at times when that loss is most painful. Behavioral: Investors make errors, or at least do not act &amp;ldquo;rationally&amp;rdquo;.  So what happens then when a strategy becomes &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://arrow.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem keeps growing and getting better (which is exciting) but I can never really remember which part is supposed to do what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m terribly sorry for a lot of over simplification here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An R Anlysis of the Beer Advocate Dataset</title>

      <description>Inspired by the LinkedIn post https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-hire-test-data-skills-one-size-fits-all-interview-tanya-cashorali/, my attempt to explore the dataset and see whatâ€™s there.
Questions: Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV%? If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick? Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer? Lastly, if I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?</description>

      <title>Experimenting with WordVectors and Codenames</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot of Codenames and came across https://jamesmullenbach.github.io/2018/01/02/codenames-fun.html which explored using word2vec to generate clue words. This was really cool! I started wondering if we could use a similar approach to actually play as a spymaster, i.e. answering the question:
Given a game board and a side, what should my clue word + targeted number be?
This post is a collection of some things I tried and the results.</description>
