      <description>Inspired by the LinkedIn post https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-hire-test-data-skills-one-size-fits-all-interview-tanya-cashorali/, my attempt to explore the dataset and see whatâ€™s there.
Questions: Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV%? If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick? Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer? Lastly, if I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?</description>
